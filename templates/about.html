    <h3>About GTS notifier</h3>

    <p>GTS notifier is a service that will send you notifications through <a href="pushover.net">pushover</a> when your trades on Pokemon X and Y's global trade station have been successful. You can receive these notifications using the <a href="https://pushover.net/clients">pushover clients</a>, available on both desktop and <a href="https://pushover.net/clients">mobile</a>.</p>
    <p>New trades are checked for every hour. Higher limits are redundant, since the global link website updates GTS trades at an unknown interval much greater than an hour. This is a problem on the global link website's end and can not be fixed by me.</p>
